##  Preparations: 

### Step 1: Get your vehicle


### Snacks:
Feel free to bring some snacks. The drive will take between 2.5 - 3 hours. I will provide bagels, croissants, and orange juice in the morning, so come on time! 

### Record your gas mileage:
SUPER IMPORTANT SO THAT WE CAN REIMBURSE YOU: Record your gas mileage before and after - joey will also take photos -- so that we can properly reimburse you for the driving.

### Step 3: 15 minute sensor warm-up period.
In order to get all the sensors warmed up and ready to measure, we will run all of the sensors in the vehicles for 15 minutes. 

While this is happening, record the current car mileage for each vehicle.

### Step 4: Go! (~10:30am)
Each of us will go our separate ways to start measuring along our prescribed transects until the route is completed. Each of the routes will lead you back to the meeting point, David Thompson Secondary School. See transect assignments above. 

Each of us will be driving approximately 70 - 80 km. Depending on traffic, this should take between 2.5 - 3 hours. 

### Step 5: Meet back at David Thompson Secondary School
Joey will collect the sensors. 

## Step 5.5: Record how many km you drove
Note how many km were driven per car for reimbursement purposes.

### Step 6: Return the vehicles to UBC and/or go free.

## Troubleshooting / Things to keep an eye on:
1. **Make sure that your sensor has 2 LED lights on**.
	a. 	If none of the lights are on, then you might need to unplug and replug your sensor. If this does not work, then please call Joey immediately. (fingers crossed this does not happen)
	b.  If 1 light is on and the other is blinking, that means that there has not been a GPS Fix yet. Please wait until both lights are fully on. In some cases, the GPS antennae might have become disconnected internally and you might have to reconnect this.
